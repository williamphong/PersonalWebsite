    p2: "My first interaction with a computer was with my dad's old ThinkPad when I was five years old. At the time, playing games on the Lego and Disney websites brought me joy and exposed me to a realm of interactive spaces. Fast forward 17 years to today, and I've graduated with a degree in Computer Science and several projects under my belt.",
    p3: "I've always been interested in developing software that has a material impact on people's lives. The first project I worked on was an educational mobile for dyslexic students as a middle school student. I've recently contributed to a VR Earth Orbit project that incorporates published research into a VR demo aimed towards helping astronomy students at a HS/College level.",
